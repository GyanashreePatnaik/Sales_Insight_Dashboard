# Sales_Insight_Dashboard

Atliq Hardware is a hardware company that sells computer hardware and peripheral devices. It has a head office in Delhi and several regional offices in various states of India. Bhavin Patel, the Sales Director, had access to data from all offices but was struggling to understand the reasons behind the massive decline in sales.

# To address this problem, we needed to analyze the data and answer specific questions such as:

• The revenue breakdown by cities

• Revenue breakdowns by years/months

• Top 5 customers by revenue and sales

• Top 5 products by revenue and profit

• Profit margins breakdown by cities.

After importing, cleaning, validating, and modifying the data, we created three dashboards that tracked all the necessary metrics.

# Here are the key insights I gathered from this project:

• Delhi NCR is the highest revenue generator, followed by Mumbai, Ahmedabad, and Bhopal.

• Surat is the most profitable market, with a profit margin of 4.9%, followed by Patna, Bhubaneswar, and Bhopal with profit margins of 4.1%, 4.0%, and 3.9%, respectively.

• 75.6% of sales are from Brick & Mortar, and the remaining 24.4% are from E-Commerce.

•  In 2020 the top 5 customers with respect to revenue are Electricalsara Stores, Electricalslytical, Excel Stores, Info Stores and Premium Stores.
